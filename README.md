# d3-datamaps-uk

This is a sample file containing d3.js Geomaps that zooms into UK in the world view. This was used in one of my previous projects and credit goes to datamaps creator for providing this as an example. What I have done is removed the propraitory code part where data is pulled from server as JSON and shown as circles in various sizes with the data text shown as tooltip.
